# Behaviour of simple FODE with varying initial conditions
Consider the following first order differential equation-
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y) $$

Say we take $f(x,y)$ in the form of $f(y)$, where the function has only output dependence.
In this section we have analysed how the the differenrtial behaves with varying initial conditions, and tried find out the patterns.

## We have taken the following differenential equations:
1. $\frac{dy}{dx}=\sin(y)$
2. $\frac{dy}{dx}=\cos(y)$
3. $\frac{dy}{dx}=(x^2-1)$
